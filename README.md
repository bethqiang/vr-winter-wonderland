# VR Winter Wonderland

A basic VR experience, filled with the goodies of winter.

Built primarily for learning and experimentation purposes.

Used [Boris Smus' WebVR boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) as a starting point. All modifications from the original are my own, unless otherwise stated.
